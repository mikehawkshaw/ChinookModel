This is Where I'll keep my notes on changes made to the Chinook Model.

I have built a function (SUB_APPLY_HCR.txt) That takes an abundance index and returns the appropriate TAC calculated based upon the tables in the June 2014 Version of the PST downloaded from the comission website.

Next step is to figure out where/when to call this sub function and to make sure the TAC variable gets passed in and out properly
